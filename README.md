# Chemical-Baum-Welch-Algorithm

This repository provides the code used for simulations in our paper "**A reaction network scheme for Hidden Markov Model parameter learning**".

# TODOS

0. Add requirements.txt
1. Add instructions to execute the code
2. Delete code that is not necessary for this paper's submission
3. Simulate using Catalyst.jl in Julia
4. Tally with Julia simulations to resolve conflicts between `1_Python_I` and `2_Python_II`
