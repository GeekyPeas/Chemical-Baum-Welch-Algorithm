# Chemical-Baum-Welch-Algorithm

This repository provides the code used for simulations in our paper "**A reaction network scheme for Hidden Markov Model parameter learning**".

In this repository 2 different source codes are provided for producing the same results:
## Python_I

1. The jupyter notebook `Python_I/Main.ipynb` can be run, which contains the simulation for `Example-1a` and `Example-2`.
2. The dependencies are mentioned in `Python_I/requirements.txt` (other than `hmmlearn` package at version `0.2.8` the other dependencies are not critical and a different version of the package may also work). 
3. Other necessary code are included in the sub-folders of `Python_II`

## Python_II
1. The jupyter notebook `Python_II/Main.ipynb` can be run, which contains the simulations for `Example-1a` and `Example-1b`.
2. The dependencies are mentioned in `Python_II/requirements.txt` (other than `crnsimulator` package at version `v0.9` and `hmmlearn` package at version `0.2.8` the other dependencies are not critical and a different version of the package may also work). 
3. Other necessary code are included in the sub-folders of `Python_II`
